# **ThreadTalk - Chat Room Connection - Client-To-Client (Message Broadcasting)**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project implements a **multi-client chat room** using Pythonâ€™s `socket` and `threading` modules. Instead of opening multiple terminal windows, multiple client scripts (`Client_1.py`, `Client_2.py`, `Client_3.py`, and `Client_4.py`) are created, allowing different clients to connect to a single server (`Server_1.py`).  

The server handles connections, broadcasts messages to all connected clients, and ensures seamless communication among them.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features  
- âœ… **Multi-client support** â€“ Up to four clients can join and chat in real time.  
- âœ… **Message broadcasting** â€“ Messages are sent to all connected clients.  
- âœ… **Alias system** â€“ Each client assigns an alias for identification.  
- âœ… **Thread-based handling** â€“ Each client connection runs in a separate thread.  
- âœ… **Automatic disconnection handling** â€“ Alerts other clients when one leaves.

## ðŸ›  Requirements  
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6+**  
- `socket` and `threading` modules (built-in in Python)  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  

### **Step 1: Start the Server**  
1. Open **Terminal or Bash** and navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ThreadTalk
Run the server:

bash
python Server_1.py
The server will start listening for incoming client connections.

Step 2: Run Multiple Clients
Open four separate terminal tabs or use multiple scripts.

Run each client in a new tab:

bash
python Client_1.py
python Client_2.py
python Client_3.py
python Client_4.py
Each client will prompt for an alias (nickname) before joining.

Step 3: Start Chatting
Clients can send messages, and the server broadcasts them to all connected clients.

If a client disconnects, the server informs others.

ðŸ”„ Example Output
Server Output:
- âœ… Server is running and listening...
- âœ… Connection established with ('127.0.0.1', 54321)
- âœ… The alias of this client is Alice
- âœ… Alice has connected to the chat room
- âœ… Connection established with ('127.0.0.1', 54322)
- âœ… The alias of this client is Bob
- âœ… Bob has connected to the chat room
Client Output (Client_1.py):
Choose an alias: Alice
- âœ… Connected to the server!
Bob: Hello, everyone!
Alice: Hi Bob!
Disconnection Handling:
If a client disconnects:

Bob has left the chat room!
ðŸ“… Future Enhancements
