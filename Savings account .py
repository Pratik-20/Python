Savings account

For the given amount of money, calculate the income from this savings account with a 5% interest rate after one year.

Here's the formula for calculating the income: income = \frac {amount \times interest \times years}{100}
income=  amount×interest×years/100
Save the result into the variable income. You DO NOT need to print it.

amount = 1000
interest_rate = 5
years = 1
# change the next line
income = (amount * interest_rate * years) / 100
