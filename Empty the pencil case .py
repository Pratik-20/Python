Work on project. Stage 1/5: Empty the pencil case
Project: Last Pencil

Empty the pencil case

Description
You and your friend decided to play a simple pen-and-paper game.
There's one catch â€” you have only pencils but no paper; the last piece of paper is gone for your beautiful drawings.
As a joke, your friend pulls all the pencils out of the case onto the table and says: "Your turn!"

Objectives In this stage, your program should print two lines: one line with several vertical bar symbols
representing pencils (for example, ||| or |||||||) and one Your turn! string.

Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

||||||||
Your turn!
Example 2:

|||
Your turn!
"""

print("||")
print("Your turn!")
